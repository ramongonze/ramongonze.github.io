Graphical tool for representing the Quantitative Information Flow (QIF) among a set of three secrets.
Developed in C/C++ all the graphic structures were made using [raylib](https://raylib.com) library and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org) to compile the project do .js and WebAssembly.

The tool is can be accessed via web browser [**here**](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~ramon.gonze/qif-graphics/).
