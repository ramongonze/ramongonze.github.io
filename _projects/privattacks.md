title: "Privattacks: A Python package for evaluating privacy risks in tabular datasets"
date: 2025-07-25
---

Privattacks is a Python package for evaluating privacy risks in tabular datasets. It provides tools to quantify re-identification and attribute inference vulnerabilities based on combinations of quasi-identifiers an adversary knows about a target. The package supports both high-level and granular analysis, including per-record vulnerability distributions, multiprocessing for efficiency, and flexible input handling via pandas DataFrames and other sources.

## Repository & Documentation
The source code is available at [Github](https://github.com/ramongonze/privattacks) and the documentation [here](https://privattacks.readthedocs.io).

## Available tools
- Prior vulnerability for re-identification and attribute inference.
- Posterior vulnerability for a given combination of qids and/or sensitive attribute.
- Posterior vulnerability for a subset of all possible combinations of QIDs.
- Parellel code.
- Generate the histogram of vulnerabilities (i.e., vulnerability per record).

## Installation
You can install via PyPI:
```

```

or manuallly by copying this repository to your local machine and running:

```
pip install path/to/privattacks
```

To verify if the package was install corretly, you can run tests:
