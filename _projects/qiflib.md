title: "Qiflib: A Python package for Quantitative Information Flow (QIF)"
date: 2022-07-01
---

**QIFLib** is a Python library for modeling, analyzing, and quantifying information leakage in probabilistic systems using the **Quantitative Information Flow (QIF)** framework.  
It provides a clean, composable set of primitives — *secrets*, *channels*, *hyper-distributions*, *vulnerability* and *uncertainty* functions — so you can build end-to-end analyses of how much information an adversary could learn.

For more details see the book [The Science of Quantitative Information Flow](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-96131-6).

## Documentation
The documentation is available at [https://pypi.org/project/qiflib/](https://pypi.org/project/qiflib/).

## Features
- **Secrets Modeling** — define hidden states with flexible prior distributions.
- **Channels** — represent probabilistic mappings $p(y\mid x)$ from secrets to observations.
- **Hyper-distributions** — automatically compute joint $p(x,y)$, outer $p(y)$, and inners $p(x\mid y)$.
- **Vulnerability Analysis** — use $g$-vulnerability to quantify an adversary’s expected gain before and after observing outputs.
- **Uncertainty Analysis** — use $\ell$-uncertainty to measure the expected loss under optimal strategies.
- **Leakage Metrics** — compute additive and multiplicative leakage.
- **Flexible Functions** — provide gain/loss as matrices or Python callables.

Why QIF?
--------

Traditional security analysis asks whether a secret *can* be inferred. QIF quantifies **how much** an adversary is expected to learn, under probabilistic models of system behavior and strategies.  
Useful for:

- privacy-preserving data publishing,
- side-channel analysis,
- communication protocol evaluation,
- decision-making under uncertainty.

## Installation
You can install via PyPI:

```bash
pip install qiflib
```

or manuallly by copying this repository to your local machine and running:

```bash
pip install path/to/qiflib   
```

To verify if the package was installed correctly, you can run tests:

```bash
cd path/to/qiflib
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Example

```python
from qiflib.core.secrets import Secrets
from qiflib.core.channel import Channel
from qiflib.core.hyper import Hyper
from qiflib.core.gvulnerability import GVulnerability

# Secrets & prior
secrets = Secrets(["x0", "x1"], [0.6, 0.4])

# Channel matrix: rows sum to 1
outputs = ["y0", "y1"]
C = [
      [0.8, 0.2],  # p(y|x0)
      [0.1, 0.9],  # p(y|x1)
]
channel = Channel(secrets, outputs, C)

# Hyper-distribution
hyper = Hyper(channel)

# Gain function (1 if correct guess, else 0)
actions = ["guess_x0", "guess_x1"]
def gfun(w, x): return 1.0 if w == x else 0.0

g = GVulnerability(secrets, actions, gfun)

print("Prior vulnerability:", g.prior_vulnerability())
print("Posterior vulnerability:", g.posterior_vulnerability(hyper))
```
